### Moi! ðŸŒž

## ðŸ¤– Test engineer, but why?
I've always been very attentive to even smallest details which somehow... resulted me to end up as software test professional.
Tale as old as time, didn't know what to do when I grow up so here we are. But I like what I do!
I have a strong passion to constantly learn new things about testing and becoming more proficient - testing having a repuration of being the underdog of software industry somehow resonates much with me.

## âœ¨ About me
- Pronouns: he/him
- Although testing and ensuring top notch quality is my profession, there's more than that
- I used to be ashamed about being a nerd, but now I have zero shame for that: you'll most likely hear me rambling about music, video games and all kinds of other nerdy tech stuff
- Fun fact: it's not very difficult to see my favorite color as I tend to buy everything in yellow
- My biggest achievement: Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time platinum trophy (I really am prouder of this than anything else!)
- Please see my resume for more information about my professional background
